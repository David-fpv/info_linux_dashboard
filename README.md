# Info Dashboard for Raspberry PI

It's a simple info dashboard for Raspberry Pi.
You can also use it for other Linux devices (though you may need to adjust a few things).

The backend is built with Node.js + Express,
and the frontend uses HTML + Bootstrap + JavaScript.


### Quick start:
 
 1. `git clone this repository`

 2. `npm init -y`

 3. `npm install express`

 4. `npm start`
