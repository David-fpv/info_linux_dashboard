# Info Dashboard for Raspberry PI

It's a simple info dashboard for Raspberry Pi.
You can also use it for other Linux devices (though you may need to adjust a few things).

The backend is built with Node.js + Express,
and the frontend uses HTML + Bootstrap + JavaScript.


### Quick start:
 
 1. `git clone https://github.com/David-fpv/info_linux_dashboard.git`

 2. `npm install`

 3. `npm start`
